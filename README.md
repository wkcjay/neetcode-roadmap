# NeetCode Roadmap Journey
## Overview
Welcome to our NeetCode Roadmap Journey! This repository is dedicated to documenting our progress as we go through the [NeetCode Roadmap](https://neetcode.io/roadmap). We will be solving problems, writing notes, and sharing insights to help us and others navigate the roadmap efficiently.
## Structure
- **Notes**: Detailed notes and explanations for each topic or problem.
- **Solutions**: Code solutions for the problems we tackle.
- **Resources**: Additional resources or references that help us better understand the concepts.
## Roadmap Progress
We will be following the structure of the NeetCode Roadmap, starting from the basics and moving towards more advanced topics. Our progress will be tracked and updated regularly in this README.
